Just wanted to welcome you to my website, which I intend to be a platform through which I share most of my personal projects as well as helpful tips/tutorials. It will mostly be computer engineering stuff but it will end up reflecting most of the areas which I love to work on.

A lot of it still needs to be added but for now I'd like to just list the projects I intend to add here:

  * three.js/webgl interesting projects
  * some convolutional neural network fun things applied to computer vision
  * big data visualization and organization - challenges of parsing obscene amounts of data
  * a home assistant design and WoT
  * unreal engine goodies, modo modelling
  * music composing is a hobby of mine too and I'm actively trying to compose my first album
  * this website (of course!) was a project of its own.

For now I'm focusing on the last of the items as without the platform I cannot really talk about the rest. So if you think these areas interest you... wait until I have rss or a mailing list set up and subscribe :)
